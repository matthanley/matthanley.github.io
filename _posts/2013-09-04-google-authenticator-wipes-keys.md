The release of version 2.0 of Google's Authenticator app for authenticating to their services with a one time password generated from your iDevice brings a long overdue UI update. What Google don't warn, however, is that installation wipes all existing keys stored on the device, potentially leaving users locked out of their accounts or facing the inconvenience of digging out their backup keys from behind the sofa.

Be warned.
